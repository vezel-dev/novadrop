# Novadrop

**Novadrop** provides a collection of libraries, tools, and documentation for
modifying the [TERA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TERA_(video_game)) game
client.

Development of TERA stopped on April 20, 2022. Official game servers shut down
on June 30 in the same year. Some of the knowledge and functionality provided by
**Novadrop** was previously held in relative secrecy by a small portion of the
game's third-party modding community for the sake of preserving game integrity.
With the game effectively defunct, **Novadrop** now enables the game's community
to freely analyze and modify the client, e.g. for the purposes of creating
unofficial server emulators.

This project offers the following packages:

* [novadrop-dc](https://www.nuget.org/packages/novadrop-dc): Provides the .NET
  global tool for manipulating TERA's data center files.
